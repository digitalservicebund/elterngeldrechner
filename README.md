are traceable and understandable. When in doubt, please refer to the respective commit and its description.

## Domain

The Elterngeldrechner is based on the Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeitgesetz (BEEG) and its related
Richtlinien. Additional relevant legal sources include the Einkommensteuergesetz (EStG), which is reflected
in our application through the Lohnsteuerrechner, as well as the Sozialgesetzbuch IV (SGB IV). The
Regelungskompetenz lies at the federal level, while the Vollzugskompetenz lies at the municipal
level. Legal amendments are published in the Bundesanzeiger, for example the annually updated
Programmablaufplan. Project partners are obligated to inform us of relevant changes.
