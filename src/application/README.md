# Elterngeldrechner und Planer - Web Application

This "package" contains a single page web-application providing the user user
tools to understand, plan and calculate _Elterngeld_ for their _Elternzeit_.

So for example it provides an interface to input personal information to
calculate exact payout amounts. It also has an interactive application part that
helps to plan the _Elternzeit_ and help to understand the possible options based
on the individual situation.

## Technical Details

The implementation is based on ReactJS. The application is sliced into its
separated features which play together.

The project has a long history with multiple service providers involved into the
development. Each and everyone left their mark with their preferences and company
resources. There are also partially incomplete refactoring remaining. In
consequence, the code base is not fully consistent and clean. There are still
leftovers from old decisions in regards of design (code and user-interface),
architecture, dependencies, linting, formatting, testing and more.

In that regard there are not many technical details worth to document for now.
