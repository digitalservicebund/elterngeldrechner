# Bemessungszeitraumrechner

This "package" provides the logic to calculate the time span of the
_Bemessungszeitraum_. _Bemessungszeitraum_ is the time period from which
the income is used to calculate the amount of _Elterngeld_.
While there is a standard case, in which the period of _Bemessungszeitraum_
is the last 12 month before the birth for not self-employed people and
the last year before the birth for self-employed people, there are
some exeptions to this rule, which makes calculations a bit more complexe.
