# Mutterschutzrechner

This "package" provides the logic to calculate the time span of the _Mutterschutz_.
_Mutterschutz_ is the time period before and after the birth of a child, in which a
mother is not allowed to work and thus receives the _Mutterschutzleistungen_.
It has an important meaning in the various contexts of _Elterngeld_.
While there is a standard case, in which the period of _Mutterschutz_ goes from
6 weeks before to 8 weeks after the birth, there are some exeptions to this rule,
which makes calculations a bit more complexe.
